# Notes backend

## Motivation
Practice React Hooks and Node/Express.

## Things I learned
* Node/Express
* Jest for unit testing
* MongoDB interaction with mongoose
* Use JSON Web Token for authentication
* How to deploy on Heroku

Node/Express RESTful API paired with the build version of
the following React Project: https://github.com/thanosades/notes-frontend

Uses MongoDB on Atlas, and JSON Web Token for authentication.

For security and maintenance reasons I kept the ability
to create a new user out of the frontend. If you want to
check the app out, the credentials are listed below.

username: superuser
password: superpass

The app can be found at https://sleepy-thicket-43745.herokuapp.com/. 
Please note that the frontend isn't finalized.
