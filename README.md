# Notes backend

My first project. Live [here](https://level-one-notes.herokuapp.com/) with really basic frontend.
The credentials to login are the following:
username: superuser
password: superpass

## Things I learned
* Node/Express
* Supertest
* MongoDB
* JSON Web Token

## New user creation
To create users go through the `POST /api/users` endpoint.
