# Notes backend

Node/Express RESTful API paired with the build version of
the following React Project: https://github.com/thanosades/notes-frontend

It listens to a MongoDB database on Atlas, and uses a
JSON Web Token for authentication.

For security and maintenance reasons I kept the ability
to create a new user out of the frontend. If you want to
check the app out, the credentials are listed below.

username: superuser
password: superpass
