# Notes backend

My first fullstack project ever. Live [here](https://sleepy-thicket-43745.herokuapp.com/).
You know how when you play an RPG game, you're high level but you still
reminisce the time when you were level 3, had some wooden sword for gear
and you kept killing slimes and bats?

This is why I don't want to improve this project. I want it to stay this way,
in all it's lack of user account creation, styling or logout button to remind me
of the old me.

## Things I learned
* React Hooks
* Node/Express
* Basic testing with Jest
* MongoDB with mongoose
* JSON Web Token for authentication
* Password salting for protection against rainbow table attacks
* How to deploy a project on Heroku

## Usage Instructions

Node/Express RESTful API paired with the build version of
the following React Project: https://github.com/thanosades/notes-frontend

Uses MongoDB on Atlas, and JSON Web Token for authentication.

For security and maintenance reasons I kept the ability
to create a new user out of the frontend. If you want to
check the app out, the credentials are listed below.

username: superuser
password: superpass


Please note that the frontend isn't finalized.
